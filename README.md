# Project description

This is my final React JS project for the SoftUni exam. It's a simple CRUD hotel-booking app. The user(creator) can register and login, create a hotel, edit the hotel or delete the hotel. The user can visit their profil page to check with what email they are sign up and delete the profile. The user(visitor) can book a hotel.

## Security futures implemented:
Guest user can not create, delete, update other users' content.
False data input handling on all input fields.
Users can not update or delete other users' content.

1. Git clone https://github.com/valentin-zhelyazkov/hotel-booking.git to your directory of choice.
2. npm install on root level.
3. cd client.
4. npm start.
5. Project is run on http://localhost:3000.
